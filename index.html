	<h1>What is NIPAP?</h1>
	<p>The Neat IP Address Planner (NIPAP) is the coolest address planner out there with an awesome and blazing fast search. IPv4 and IPv6 are equals in NIPAP - that is, complete feature parity exist for the two address families. Assigning new addresses is as easy as 1 2 3 with the integrated and easy-to-use address pool assignment features.</p>

	<p>If you wish to integrate your own system with NIPAP, fear not, for NIPAP is built with a simple XML-RPC middleware. Both the web and CLI interact with the database through the XML-RPC API to 100%, guaranteeing that any feature available via the regular interfaces are also available to you.</p>

	<p>Start by looking at some <a href="screenshots.html">screenshots of the gorgeous web interface</a> or check out the <a href="http://nipap-demo.spritelink.net/">demo installation</a> (login with demo/demo).</p>

In particular, there is an add-on called ip4r that adds index functionality to columns used to store IP addresses which is crucial to this project.
