	<h1>Documentation</h1>
	<p>The source code of NIPAP is not overly complex and is fairly well documented making it overall rather easy to understand. Sphinx is used to generate pretty HTML pages directly from the source code which you can find at the following link:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="nipap/index.html">Reference documentation</a>
		<li><a href="jnipap/index.html">Java API</a>
	</ul>
